      What is OOP ?
 
   -  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather
       than functions and logic.An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.


      List OOP concepts 
   
      Class - Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.


     Object- Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity.
                When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.



     * What is the difference between OOP and POP? 


      Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

      - OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the system.
      - The data of an object can be accessed only by the function associated with that object. However, function of one object can access the function of other objects.

     
       Procedural Oriented Programming (POP)
       - In the procedure oriented approach, large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.
      -  In a multi-function program, many important data items are placed as global so that they may be accessed by all the functions. Each function may have its own local data.
